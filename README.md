## Problem Statement

There are too much hustle and bustle in any sort of queue (i.e. Queue of patients in the hospital, Queue in banks, Service centers, etc.). Due to that a lot of time is wasted and the patients, customers or consumers face a lot of problems. And the human resources are also required to manage that crowd.

## Reason for Selecting the Topic

We face this problem on the daily basis and we frequently waste our time due to such problems. At the time of servicing of car or vehicle, a lot of time is wasted while standing in the queue and consumers wait for the vehicles in customer lounge if there is some automatized system for this that your vehicle is ready after servicing then the time wastage will be reduced.

## Objectives of the Project

 - Reduce the time wastage of people who wait in the queue.
 - Reduce the human resources used for maintaining the crowd.
 - Help the people to deal with their work easily.

## Literature Survey / Feasibility Study

We visited Sir Ganga Ram Hospital situated in Delhi, India. We saw people fighting for the appointments with the doctor as there was no First in First out (FIFO) rule being followed or any sort of strategy to maintain the huge crowd present on the reception.

We have also seen this sort of problem in Indian Overseas Bank located in our college. During the time of fee submission, students who pay fee through cash, wait in the queue to submit their fee due to which sometimes they were marked absent by their respective faculties. Later on, they face attendance issues.

## Future Scope

As we are making an android version as well as a website for our project, companies will use our application and website to manage the queue of customers in their offices so as to reduce the inconvenience of the employees as well as of the customers.

## Methodology

The project Queue Management is an application developed to manage the queuing for services in hospitals and government offices without committing to the estimated time for their demand.

Waiting for the service is counterproductive which consumes an unacceptable amount of productive time for the patients. We develop the system to manage the queue without physically lining up and allow people monitor their queue status by their handsets. The project accomplishes its objectives as a solution to customers, patients to access their queues remotely over the internet through a android application.

## What contribution would the project make and where?

The project will be helpful for the managers and service providers who need to control the flow of customers. Places like hospitals, service centres, banks have a lot of rush. This project will help to manage the crowd at these places so that their work could be more efficient and they can provide the services to the customers properly.

## Scope for extension into a major project

 - Shift from mailing system to messaging system.
 - Implementation of IVRS (Interactive Voice Response System).
 - Generation of live timer.

## Conclusion:

A growing population base will continue having a pressure to the existing facilities. With the cycle of limited facilities, it leads to the coupled staffing shortages which will guarantee that long queues to remain synonymous anytime visiting a hospital and other public service facilities. So this project will solve the inconvenience of the public and staff due to the long unwanted queues.
